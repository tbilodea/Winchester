I cannot believe it has come to this...my beloved husband  and little girl are gone. 
Words and anger cannot express my loss...I have screamed...tore my hair out. 
In one brief moment they were both gone. 
...
I walked into the piano room to bring Mr. Hannover some tea and there he was, crumpled against his favorite piano with a glazed look in his eye.
So shocked was I that I screamed. Daisy came around the corner and begged me to not make a fuss. 
That he would not buy her any more pets.
It was then that I lost my control and shook her.
She went to recover, and before doing so, stepped backwards off the top stair.
I saw her body relax as she hit the ground.
Immediately I felt dreadful and my stomach flipped. 
Daisy did not rise. 
...
Now I must bury both my sweet husband and my little girl in the ground.

April 1964
My guilt has never ceased. 
She comes to me sometimes at night. At first I thought I had gone insane but it was clear that this was my Daisy. 
I thought that in aiding Daisy I would lose some of the burdensome pain and guilty conscience.
But my guilt is ever constant.

Sometimes I miss the carpenter-Yidel. He was such a comfort in this large house. 
All his furniture reminds me of the companion I lost. Then again Daisy was getting bored and it was time. 
The days run together here. I don't rightly know the date or time anymore. 
The clocks have been broken without someone to repair them. 
At least my Daisy is content.
