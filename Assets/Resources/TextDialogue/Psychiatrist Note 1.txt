At first impression the girl is utterly abnormal. 
She has a way of being disconcerting while also ensnaring you with her charms. For she can be very charming if she so desires. 
The girl's parents appear to be pleasant enough people. 
They obviously bend to their daughter's every whim and fancy. 
I somehow suspect that it is not fully out of the desire to spoil the girl but because they fear her. 
When I asked what brought me to their door they responded that their little girl was acting “unnaturally”. 
Indeed upon meeting Daisy it is clear that she is no normal little girl. More sessions are needed with Daisy to uncover her true nature.
