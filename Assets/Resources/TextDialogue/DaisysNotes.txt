Dear diary,
I'm wondering what Father is to do with me.
He seems distant lately.
I'd like to see his brain to find out how he ticks.
Like that clock I dismantled.
I don't get why he and the Doctor hate what I do. I'm supposed to learn, aren't I?
Thankfully Mother is ever so generous to me.
She lets me play the way I want to.
I'm ready to move forward with my studies.
Maybe I will soon. I didn't get much chance with the boy.
People are so interesting.
Lovingly yours,
Daisy Hannover
