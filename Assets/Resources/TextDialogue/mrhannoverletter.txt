Dear Mr. Simmons,
Thank you for being so patient with me the other day. As you can imagine, this is a hard decision for me.
After touring your facilities it seems to me to be the proper time to get Daisy in the right hands.
Mrs. Hannover will not take this well...she seems to be in a state of denial.
I suggest when you come, you bring extra men with you. 
I know for certain it will be a scene, and I fear the reactions of Daisy and Mrs. Hannover both.
...
Regards,
Mr. Hannover
