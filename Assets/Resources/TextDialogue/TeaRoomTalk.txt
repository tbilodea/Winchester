Mrs. Hannover: Why hello there! You gave us quite the scare! This is Robin Sawyer. He found you collapsed in the road.
Annabelle: And who are you?
Mrs. Hannover: I'm Miss Hannover. I arrived just after Robin did.
Robin: Hi, Annabelle!
Annabelle: Okay...why am I here and not in a hospital??
Mrs. Hannover: Oh well, I used to be a nurse, and the nearest hospital was another 2 hours away.
Mrs. Hannover: So I checked you over and we got you here. I can assure you your arm will be fine. Just a little break.
Robin: Mrs. Hannover was just telling me about the house. Seems pretty interesting.
Annabelle: Oh?
Robin: Yeah. It was originally built by her husband's father back in the early 1900s.
Annabelle: That's nice...and where is Mr. Hannover?
Mrs. Hannover: He passed away some years ago.
Annabelle: I'm sorry to hear that.
Mrs. Hannover: It's not a problem dear, I've gotten used to the house as is.
Robin: So now that I see you're awake, I think I'll be on my way.
Mrs. Hannover: So soon? Oh dear. Well, I will have to lead you to the front door.
Robin: Annabelle, would you like to come with me?
*What a weird question...Why would he be asking me that?*
*There's a mark of tension on his face*
Mrs. Hannover: She needs her rest still. She's been through quite the ordeal. 
Mrs. Hannover: I must insist she stays another night.
Robin: Oh. Okay...well. I hope you feel better soon Annabelle.
*He is acting so odd about leaving...*
Mrs. Hannover: Annabelle, I strongly suggest you stay on this level. This house is incredibly confusing and large.
Mrs. Hannover: You don't want to get lost.
Mrs. Hannover: There's also alot of historical areas that shouldn't be touched.
Mrs. Hannover: So stay on this level please.
*This place is a bit off. I kind of wish they'd taken me to a hospital.*
*I definitely don't feel bad apart from my arm. I guess I'll adventure around a bit.*
