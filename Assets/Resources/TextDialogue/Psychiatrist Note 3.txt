Lately Daisy has been complaining of the other children teasing her. 
This can be very harmful to a youngster and for a brief spell I was filled with pity for the girl. 
It is quickly replaced with disgust when her face begins to grow dark and venomous. 
It is clear that she does not intend to take the abuse much longer. 
She has shown me her box of “trinkets” that includes various animal tags and animal nails. 
She is rather pleased with this box. It is her prized collection. 
At my last visit she inquired what my greatest fear was and I could see her plotting something sinister. 
She enjoys learning and stalking her prey. I shan't be coming back here. 
I do not have a death wish. 
I have disclosed my final advice to the Hannovers that she should be locked away as soon as possible for she is a great danger to anyone that crosses her path. 
I fear for anyone that comes into this home.
