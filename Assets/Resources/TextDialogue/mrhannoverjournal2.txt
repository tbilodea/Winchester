December 1963
I don't think the psychologist we hired has helped.
Daisy hasn't changed for the better. I am fairly sure she has gotten worse.
I think Mrs. Hannover is scared of punishing her. I am as well, but I do not believe it would help.
People only tend to change only under extreme circumstances.
I do not want to bring about these extreme circumstances, but I have reached out to the premiere institute for such things.
Mr. Simmons is the man who runs them. He seems to have his head on straight. I am to meet with him soon to tour the facility.
Even if it is as horrible as I imagine, I don't know if I can risk the health of everyone around me to keep our daughter here.
