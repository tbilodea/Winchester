Property of Robin
*He must've forgot about it on his way out...it's open to his last entry*
September 2nd, 1972
I was on my way to San Jose today when I came across a crash on the backroads.
No one was around so I searched.
I found a woman lying in the road not too far away.
Just as I was about to help her into my car, Miss Hannover drove up.
She seemed nice enough and claimed to be a nurse and she lived up the road a bit.
The nearest hospital was hours away, so I figured it was harmless.
After getting Annabelle in, I'm unsure she actually was a nurse.
And she is off.
The house is off.
It hasn't been updated since the 1910s and has lights running off of gas still.
But that's not why I think the house is off.
I heard faint piano playing last night.
When I asked Mrs. Hannover if she played the piano shes said no, but her husband did.
And Mrs. Hannover claims her husband died years ago.
I asked her if someone else was in the house, she played it off like it was the groaning of the house.
But I heard a piano.
I can also hear the house.
It's like it is breathing.
And I feel like I'm being watched.
...
I only stayed to see that the woman I found is okay.
Mrs. Hannover is lying about something, and this place doesn't seem right.
I'm leaving as soon as Annabelle wakes up. I hope she will come with me.
