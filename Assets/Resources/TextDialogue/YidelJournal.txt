I'm trapped in a room with no windows.
And now I have no sense of time.
Daisy has broken every clock in the house.
They use to control the room rotation.
Now I'm trapped, waiting for death.
Mrs. Hannover shows up occasionally to take my creations away.
My hands are tired and calloused.
I'm tired of this existance.
I can't imagine they'll keep me around much longer anyway.
I might as well try to take a stand.
If you're reading this get out.
Use the clocks to rotate the rooms.
