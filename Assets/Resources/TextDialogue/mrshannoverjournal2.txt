Do you suppose it is something I've done wrong as a mother? I am at my wits end trying to figure out how to help my little Daisy. 
She refuses to listen to either Mr. Hannover or myself. I cannot bring myself to be cross with her but my patience is wearing thin. 
The psychiatrist came to see Daisy a few days ago and was quite alarmed at her nature. Oh I hope he can help our little girl.
