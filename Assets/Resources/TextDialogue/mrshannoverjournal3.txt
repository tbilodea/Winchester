November 12, 1963
Daisy came home a few days ago complaining that the other children were taunting her and calling her names. 
I have heard them before. They dance around her and chant “Crazy Daisy” with horrible bouts of laughter. 
Henry Wilchester's mother phoned saying that Henry did not come home last night after he had been out playing with friends. 
My gut that told me that Daisy had something to do with it...
Does it make me a horrible mother? 
Sure enough there was a fresh plot of earth piled in the back yard where Oscar and the others are buried. 
I won't let them to take away my Daisy.
I wished Mrs. Wilchester luck in finding her son.
