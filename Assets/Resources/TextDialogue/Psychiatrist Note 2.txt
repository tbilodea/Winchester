Sitting across from Daisy I am filled with dread. 
She has come to know me as a regular visitor and thus does not treat me like a stranger. 
She confides in me occasionally about her demonic desires. 
Her parents have purchased her any number of pets but they always vanish not long after they arrive. 
When I ask where they have gone Daisy merely remarks that they served their purpose. 
She often inquires about the human anatomy and how it relates to various beasts. 
For instance she once asked if a human neck would snap like a rabbits. 
I refuse to entertain these fancies. It is clear that the girl has no love flowing through her body. 
Indeed she rarely shows emotion 
except those instances where she cannot hide her extreme pleasure when discussing torture and death. 
I have made it known to the Hannovers that it would be best if she was locked away in a secure location 
for the safety and benefit of all living things. 
They are reluctant, as any good parents would be, to allow this but I believe they are aware that this is 
the necessary course of action or they would not have called upon a psychologist for help.
