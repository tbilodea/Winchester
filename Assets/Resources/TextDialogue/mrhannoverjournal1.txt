August 1963
All I ever seem to worry and write about is my daughter as of late. 
The subject has even worked itself into my music. It has a more haunting atmosphere than before. 
Her mother is not as firm as I have been nor as adamant that she reacquires to be examined. 
Of course I love and worry about my daughter but there is also an element of fear that her mother refuses to acknowledge. 
One should not live in fear of one's child. Of this I am sure. 
Although I must be careful because Daisy can become inflamed in an instant and Lord knows what she can or will do in an act of passion. 
Yes. I fear for us all.
